IsUnique
	Is there a more efficient way of implementing this method?
	This assumes that every char, both lowercase and uppercase are unique values

CheckPermutation
	I have it completed and done, however I know it can be better, so this is my note to go back and fix the time complexity. 

URLify
	Is there a more efficient way of implementing this method? 

PalindromPermutation
	I would like to find another way to do this that doesn't use 2 foreach loops, however I do like this solution - I find it easy to read
		Also, in the second foreach loop, I used KeyValuePair<char, int> instead of var, I find it easier to read at a glance. I know it's not my normal formatting, but I'm not worried about changing the type of my pair variable.

OneAway
	I do have 2 loops here... one to add all the chars to the list and the other to compare the lists... I'm assuming this would be more of a brute solution than not because of that
	Would the efficiency be O(n) because the loops aren't operating in each other?

StringCompression
	Honestly, in itself, I like this one. 
	An important thing I found worth mentioning to my future self is noting the ASCII table when getting the key and value pair from my dictionary<char, int>. When I called my key, I got the ASCII number (a being 97), and  I added my int value to the ASCII number (for example, if 'a' occured 4 times in my string, it would have been 101 instead of "a4")
		To properly create this string, you need to call the pair as 
			compressed += pair.key.ToString() + pair.value.ToString(); 
			converting the key and value to string allows proper concatentation	
		I didn't see this issue until I wrote the method in VS; I didn't notice this on paper

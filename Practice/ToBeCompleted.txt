IsUnique
	Is there a more efficient way of implementing this method?
	This assumes that every char, both lowercase and uppercase are unique values

CheckPermutation
	I have it completed and done, however I know it can be better, so this is my note to go back and fix the time complexity. 

URLify
	Is there a more efficient way of implementing this method? 

PalindromPermutation
	I left this off in the middle of a brute force solution, one that is brute even for a brute force
	Do a brute force solution in another way
	This assumes that every char, both lowercase and uppercase are unique values

OneAway
	I do have 2 loops here... one to add all the chars to the list and the other to compare the lists... I'm assuming this would be more of a brute solution than not because of that
	Would the efficiency be O(n) because the loops aren't operating in each other?
